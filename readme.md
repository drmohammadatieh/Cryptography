## Cryptography

This is an exercise on cryptography as part of the Secure Software Development course of the CS PgCert at the University of Essex Online. 

## Instructions

Read the Cryptography with Python blog at tutorialspoint.com (link is in the reading list). Select one of the methods described/ examples given and create a python program that can take a short piece of text and encrypt it.

## Questions & Answers

### 1. Why did you select the algorithm you chose?

I chose the RSA algorithm because it is very strong and hard to hack due to the following reasons: very time-consuming for brute force attacks, uses numeric keys rendering dictionary attack impossible, and very difficult to hack using frequency analysis or any mathematical tricks (Tutorialspoint,n.d).


### 2. Would it meet the GDPR regulations? Justify your answer.

It meets the GDPR regulations because it protects personal data with a very strong encryption type.
